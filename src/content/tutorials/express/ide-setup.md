# Setting up VS Code for development 

## Extensions

Go into the extensions tab on the left handside and install the following extensions to help you:
- Code Spell Checker
- ESLint
- vscode-icons cause it'll make it look better 


## Settings

I recommend changing one setting to open the settings pane you just need to hit ctrl/cmd + , then look for the line wrap setting and activate it
